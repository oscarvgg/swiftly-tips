Every time you use a semicolon (`;`) in swift, a tree dies ðŸ™„. Don't roll your eyes! It's true.

Don't use them, they are a thing of the past. They make your code look ugly and nasty.

Look how ugly:

```swift
let lukeSkywalker = JediKnight();
lukeSkywalker.savePrincessLeia();
```
Now look how beautiful:

```swift
let lukeSkywalker = JediKnight()
lukeSkywalker.savePrincessLeia()
```
Nice, clean, perfect ðŸ˜Œ.
